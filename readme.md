### format_and_save_raw.py: 
* modify variable "file_path_list" with the file paths of the raw data you want to format:
* ex:

        ```
        file_path_list = [
            r"<YOUR FILE PATH 1 HERE>",
            r"<YOUR FILE PATH 2 HERE>",
            r"<YOUR FILE PATH 3 HERE>"
        ]
        ```
